# Record List(React + TypeScript)

Interactive record list.

At the top of the project we have a name, under the name there is a counter of completed and current tasks.

Next we have a container with an input for adding new records.

In the next container there is a filter, with three options: All, Completed, Current.

And last, the main container with a list of records. When you click on it, the record is marked as completed or not with the corresponding color.
